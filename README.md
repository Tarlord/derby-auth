# Derby.js Authentication

Provides authentication middleware (using [Passport](http://passportjs.org/)) for use in your Derby projects. For usage details, see [example](https://github.com/lefnire/derby-auth/tree/master/example).

## Why not EveryAuth?
This project was originally implemented with Everyauth ([see branch](https://github.com/lefnire/derby-auth/tree/everyauth)), but had some issues:
  1. Every provider had to be implemented individually in code. Passport has an abstraction layer, which is what allows us to pass in Strategy + conf objects in server/index.js for every provider we want enabled.
  2. Password authentication posed technical difficulties. See the [Google Group discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/derbyjs/JuUqUNd9Rls)
