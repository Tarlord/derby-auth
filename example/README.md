# Derby.js Authentication Example

Uses [derby-auth](https://github.com/lefnire/derby-auth) to provide authentication to DerbyJS. Check out `server/index.js` and `views/auth/index.html`.

To run this example, `npm install && cd .. && npm install` (you need node_modules for both this & above directories). Then run `node server.js` and navigate to http://localhost:3000
